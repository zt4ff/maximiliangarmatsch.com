# maximiliangarmatsch.com
www.maximiliangarmatsch.com is my main portfolio item that also uses my personal frontend-boilerplate. 

### 1. Setup
```
npm install
npm start
```

### 2. Deployment
I use AWS CI/CD for automatic deployment. 
After pushing a branch, AWS automatically creates a preview build including snapshots. 
When a pullrequest is merged to the master branch, AWS automatically deploys to production.

#### Working Tools / Code Quality Tools
- Commitlint: makes sure that commit messages are formatted nicely.
- ESLint: Formats code nicely and shows typos.
- Prettier
- Babel
- ....
